# OS/VS2 SVS version 1.7

This repo contains the distribution libraries (from tape) for OS/VS2 SVS version 1.7. 

The software is by IBM, so I am posting it here. However, the sysgen instructions are by Mark Waterbury, so I am not posting them because they belong to him. Pls ask him for the instructions. He's a very nice gentleman and he will point you to the mailing list file sections where he uploaded his instructions. 

thanks
